# Builder React Starter

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

Be sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system

### Download and install

```
git clone https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder.git
cd builder/starters/react
npm install
```

### Make a free Builder.io account

Then, create a free account at [builder.io](https://builder.io) and grab your public API key from builder.io/account/organization

Paste your API key at the top of [src/App.js](src/App.js#5)

### Run the dev server

```
npm run develop
```

This will host your site at http://localhost:3000

### Create content in Builder

Head back over to [builder.io](https://builder.io), and create a new page with url /page-1 and publish it (green button in top right corner)

Now go over to http://localhost:3000 to see your content live!

### Deploy

You can deploy your site with [many services](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

For a quick and easy deployment, create an account at [firebase.com](https://firebase.com)

Then from this project directory, run

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init # be sure to choose "hosting" when prompted
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

And you are live!

## Detail on project commands

This project was generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
