## Builder.io example with building a design system in React

In this example we show how to integrate react components with [Builder.io](https://builder.io)

ðŸ‘‰**Tip: want to limit page building to only your components? Try [components only mode](https://builder.io/c/docs/guides/components-only-mode)**

### To run the example Locally

- [Sign in or create an account](https://builder.io)
- Create a page [model](https://builder.io/c/docs/guides/getting-started-with-models) if you don't have one already
- Create an entry from your page model and add a URL path (e.g `/home`)
- From the command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder.git
cd examples/react-design-system
npm install
npm start
```

- Now that you have the development server running on localhost, point the Builder.io entry to it by assigning the preview URL to be : `http://localhost:3000/home`
