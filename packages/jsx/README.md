# Builder.io JSX support

A TypeScript custom transformer which enables you to use JSX with Builder.io

## Why

1. Write JSX code that can compile and render to any language or framework using [Builder.io's various SDKs](../packages)
2. Edit the JSX code visually using Builder.io's editor and write code / use your own coding tools _side by side_
